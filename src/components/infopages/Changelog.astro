      <h3>Version 1.0 | Dec 17, 2024</h3>
      <p>Out of beta and officially into the AppStore! Thanks to everyone who's been with us 
        during these Beta days! ü•∞üôèüéâ
      </p>
      <p>New features for Pro users (which remember: you should be since you don't actually get charged while in Beta!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personalized Views: Customize your product screens by hiding fields you don't use or find irrelevant</li>
        <li>Expiration tracking: Track both printed expiration dates and post-opening shelf lives for your beauty products. We try to distinguish between these two types to help you maintain product safety</li>
        <li>With all these new fields, we tried to simplify the "Add Product" screen a bit. Did it work?</li>
        <li>Automatic background removal: Product images now feature automatic background removal, making it easier to maintain a clean, consistent look‚Äîespecially helpful for images captured from the web.</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>Bug fixes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Local backup files are now accessible through the Files app, allowing you to copy them to a secure (better) location that persists after app deletion.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the brand/product autocomplete wasn't working correctly for existing products</li>
        <li>Resolved name deduplication issues affecting specific brands (such as Sephora Collection)</li>
        <li>Added ability to remove ratings (thanks Brenna!)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>V2.1 (171) | Dec 4, 2024</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>New feature:</b> preview cards! Individual products now have a "Share" button in their action menu. It generates a colorful card you can share with friends. You know, for when you're asked "What are your favorite sunscreens again?"</li> 
        <li>An "add product" button has appeared directly in the grid</li>
        <li>Bug fix: less mystery around why you can't save a product (thanks Maeghan!)</li>
        <li>Bug fix: slightly less mystery (but never zero) as to why iCloud sync might be on the fritz (thanks Brenna!)</li>
        <li>Bug fix: you can swipe successfully out of the tutorial flow. For real this time (also thanks Brenna!)</li>
        <li>Team updates: Monica bought a Burt's Bees BB Cream ("it makes me break out") and Brittany is in Japan accumulating future updates.</li>
      </ul> 
      <h3>V2.1 (159) | Nov 12, 2024</h3>

        <li>Product categories are now slightly less case-sensitive</li> 
        <li>Updated the Collections page for non-pro users to make it clearer 
          the data is hiding, not gone</li>
        <li>Updated the links in Settings to point to our brand new website </li>
        <li>Minor bug fixed based on user feedback!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>V2.1 (154) | Nov 10, 2024</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Welcome to the BeautyMark Beta!! </li>
        <li>We've added a paywall, but don't fret: in-app purchases while in Beta 
          use the special TestFlight sandbox environment, so they're free to testers. 
          You can double check that before you press the final Apple purchase button -- 
          there should be a message that tells you no charge will actually be applied.</li>
        </li>
